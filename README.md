# Word Synthesizer ðŸ”¤

An interactive web application for mixing word embeddings and exploring semantic neighborhoods in real-time. Mix word2vec/GloVe/fastText embeddings with floating-point sliders and see nearest neighbors update live, plus an optional 3D neighborhood visualization.

## Features

- **Interactive Word Mixing**: Blend word embeddings using weighted sliders
- **Real-time Nearest Neighbors**: See results update as you adjust weights
- **3D Semantic Visualization**: Explore word neighborhoods in 3D space using UMAP
- **Multiple Embedding Formats**: Support for word2vec, GloVe, and fastText
- **FAISS Acceleration**: Fast similarity search when available (graceful fallback)
- **Export Results**: Download nearest neighbors as CSV

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv word-synth-env
source word-synth-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: word-synth-env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download Embeddings

Choose one of these options:

#### Option A: GoogleNews word2vec (Recommended)
```bash
# Download GoogleNews vectors (1.5GB)
wget https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM&export=download -O GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin
```

#### Option B: GloVe
```bash
# Download GloVe vectors
wget https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
unzip glove.6B.zip

# Convert to word2vec format (install glove2word2vec first)
pip install glove2word2vec
glove2word2vec glove.6B.300d.txt glove.6B.300d.word2vec.txt
```

#### Option C: fastText
```bash
# Download fastText vectors
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-english/crawl-300d-2M.vec.zip
unzip crawl-300d-2M.vec.zip
```

### 3. Configure Settings

Edit `settings.py` to point to your embedding file:

```python
# For GoogleNews word2vec
EMBEDDINGS_PATH = "GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin"
IS_BINARY = True

# For GloVe (converted)
EMBEDDINGS_PATH = "glove.6B.300d.word2vec.txt"
IS_BINARY = False

# For fastText
EMBEDDINGS_PATH = "crawl-300d-2M.vec"
IS_BINARY = False
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

1. **Enter a Base Word**: Type a word in the sidebar (default: "king")
2. **Adjust Sliders**: Use the sliders to mix different words with weights from -2.0 to 2.0
3. **View Results**: See nearest neighbors update in real-time
4. **3D Visualization**: Toggle the 3D view to explore semantic neighborhoods
5. **Export Data**: Download results as CSV for further analysis

## Example: Word Arithmetic

Try these classic examples:

- **king - man + woman â‰ˆ queen**
  - Set "king" to 1.0, "man" to -1.0, "woman" to 1.0

- **paris - france + italy â‰ˆ rome**
  - Set "paris" to 1.0, "france" to -1.0, "italy" to 1.0

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **synth.py**: Core model class handling embeddings and similarity search
- **app.py**: Streamlit web interface
- **settings.py**: Configuration parameters
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies

### Performance

- **Memory Usage**: ~1.5-2.5GB RAM for typical models
- **FAISS Acceleration**: Optional fast similarity search
- **Apple Silicon**: FAISS may not install; app falls back gracefully to gensim

### Supported Formats

| Format | File Extension | Binary | Notes |
|--------|----------------|--------|-------|
| word2vec | .bin | Yes | GoogleNews format |
| word2vec | .txt | No | Text format |
| GloVe | .txt | No | Convert with glove2word2vec |
| fastText | .vec | No | Native fastText format |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Embeddings file not found"**
- Check that your embedding file is in the project directory
- Verify the path in `settings.py` is correct
- Ensure the file downloaded completely

**"Word not found in vocabulary"**
- Try a more common word
- Check spelling
- Some models are case-sensitive

**FAISS installation fails (Apple Silicon)**
- This is expected on M1/M2 Macs
- The app will work fine with gensim fallback
- Performance may be slower but still functional

**Memory issues**
- Close other applications
- Try a smaller embedding model
- Consider using Google Colab for larger models

### Performance Tips

- Use FAISS when available for faster similarity search
- Limit the number of basis words for better performance
- Rebuild 3D neighborhood only when needed
- Use smaller neighborhood sizes for faster 3D visualization

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Directions

The app includes a helper function for computing semantic directions:

```python
# Example: gender direction
pairs = [("woman", "man"), ("queen", "king"), ("girl", "boy")]
direction = model.directions_from_pairs(pairs)
```

### API Usage

You can also use the model programmatically:

```python
from synth import SynthModel

# Load model
model = SynthModel("path/to/embeddings.bin", binary=True)

# Mix words
weights = [("king", 1.0), ("man", -1.0), ("woman", 1.0)]
vector = model.mix(weights)

# Find neighbors
neighbors = model.nearest(vector, topn=10)
print(neighbors)
```
